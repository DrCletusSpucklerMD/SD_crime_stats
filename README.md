# SD_crime_stats

## A notebook generated from the San Diego Police Department’s 2021 Uniform Crime Report (UCR) data as found [here](https://www.sandiego.gov/police/data-transparency/crime-statistics/annual-crime-report).


This is one of my first attempts at data visualization with matplotlib, seaborn, and scikitlearn. So be nice.

Most of this code is just copy/paste from various StackOverflow forums I do not care to cite. These data and this notebook are purely intended to entertain me as a hobbiest.
